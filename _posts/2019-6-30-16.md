This 40-episode documentary covers the history from the inception of China’s contact with the imperial powers until the end of WWII. It shows the audience that the tension between Japan and China develops way earlier than the conventional wisdom has assumed. The documentary succeeds not only in recording the history of Sino-Japanese struggles throughout the past 60 years, but also provides rich evidence for the warcrimes committed by Japanese in economic and cultural aspects.
