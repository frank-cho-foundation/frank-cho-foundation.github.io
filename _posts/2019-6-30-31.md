This documentary begins with the story of Numata Suzuko, who has been working as a social activist after the WWII. Since the end of the WWII, Suzuko has been giving lectures on the horrible stories about the disaster and calling for global awareness to the unhealed wound of the innocent civilians. It  reveals to the audience that talking about the atomic bombs without referring to the life loss of other countries is unfair to those people who sacrificed themselves in defending their own countries from the Japanese Imperial Army.
