This documentary familiarizes the audience with two major forms of memorialization after 50 years of the war: the visiting Yasukuni Shrine and the Peace Museum in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. While recognizing the damages born by Japan, the documentary criticizes the unilateral memory indoctrinated by Japanese government that depicts Japan as merely a victim, instead of a perpetrator of the WWII.
