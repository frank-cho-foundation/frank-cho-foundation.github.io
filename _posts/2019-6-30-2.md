This documentary gives a holistic introduction of the confession of Azuma Shiro, a Japanese veteran from Nanking Massacre, and the Chinese communitiesâ€™ reaction to this confession. His experience echoes with his peers who were once the perpetrators, but his diary reveals more heartrending details of the atrocity and the deeper reason behind it.
