This is the English version of the record of Reverend Magee, who had witnessed the bestiality of Japanese soldiers in Nanking. The documentary relays the horrors of WWII committed by the Japanese army in China with John Magee’s son narrating. The narrator recollected his memories of the patients who were wounded by the Japanese soldiers in the Drum Tower hospital. Besides Magee’s testaments, some massacre survivors also looked back on that horrible period of time and provided evidence of the Nanjing Massacre.
