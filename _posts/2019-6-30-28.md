This documentary starts from an inquiry on the Kamikaze, the suicidal aerial squad established at the end of WWII to destroy the U.S. battleships, and attempts to explore the  reasons behind the seemingly irrational decision made by these Japanese youth. As the documentary digs deeper into this issue, the audience is challenged with the existing problems about how Japanese views the war fought by their fathers. Moreover, the video contains many precious videos filmed during the war, strong evidence that supports the credibility of war crimes (Unit 731, Nanjing Massacre, and forced labor) committed by Japanese Imperial Army, and summaries of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East.
