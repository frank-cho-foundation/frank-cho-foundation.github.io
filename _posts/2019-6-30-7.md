This movie artistically restores the Nanking Massacre by presenting the unimaginable degree of violence along with the ideological development of the Japanese imperial military. Many scenarios presented in the movies are based on the historical records and photos. Even though the plot is not historically accurate, it nevertheless shows the audience how Chinese people perceive and remember their national trauma.
