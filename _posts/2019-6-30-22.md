This documentary discusses the controversy of the Yasukuni Shrine as well as Japan’s memory of the Second World War. This video casts a contrast of two voices in the current Japanese society: the right wing groups that try to revise and whitewash the history of Japan’s invasion and war crimes, and the anti-war groups that urge for a reexamination based on the historical facts and a reconciliation with the victimized countries during the WWII.
