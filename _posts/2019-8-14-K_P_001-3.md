This document instructs an end in recruiting comfort women for the Japanese military in China in Kouchi Prefecture due to the increasing number of the Japanese travelers to China. And it also requires the official ID being assigned to the Japanese comfort women who were already in service. Moreover, expresses the misgiving of the negative impact to the morale comfort women might have exerted on the army.
