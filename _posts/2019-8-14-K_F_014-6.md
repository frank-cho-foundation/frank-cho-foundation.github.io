This document is a continuance of the record of identity certificate issuance to the travelers from Taiwan to Mainland China. It includes reasons such as family reunion, construction work, medical practice, business trip prostitution and investigation. However, the category “military comforting” listed separately from other employment is a euphemism for the comfort women.
