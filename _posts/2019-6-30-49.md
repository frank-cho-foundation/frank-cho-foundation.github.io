This documentary is based on the record of an American Missionary John Gillespie Magee, who had witnessed the horrendous atrocities carried out by Japanese military in Nanking in 1937. On the one hand, rejects the claims of certain Japanese historians that Nanking Massacre was a fabricated case for the sake of tarnishing Japan’s international reputation. On the other hand, it provides the audience with a western perspective over the Japanese war crimes.
