This documentary explores the facts and details about the Nanking Massacre through a research on John Rabe, the “good Nazi” in Nanking who had saved the life of thousands of Chinese civilians. It also features in an interview with Iris Chang, the author of the Rape of Nanking, to find out the reasons behind the capacity of Japanese soldiers to carry out such a degree of violence in a short period of time.
