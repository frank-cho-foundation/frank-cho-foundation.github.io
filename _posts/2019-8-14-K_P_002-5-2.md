This document concerns the arrangement of Japanese comfort women departed from Nagasaki, a major port city, when they reached Shanghai. It mainly concerns the identity certificates, checks of physical condition, and housing arrangement for the newly-arrived comfort women. It also emphasizes that the same practices should be repeated on the comfort women recruited from other regions such as Korea.
