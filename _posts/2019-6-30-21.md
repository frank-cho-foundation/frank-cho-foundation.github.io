This episode from China Report Program discusses Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi Junichiro’s impending worship of the Yasukuni Shrine, where the Tojo Hideki and other first-class war criminals of WWII was enshrined as national heroes. The scholars point out that this activity is not only morally deplorable but politically unwise, since it would make it harder for Japan to reconcile with its neighboring countries such as South Korea and China.
