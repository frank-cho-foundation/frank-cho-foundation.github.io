This document concerns the arrangement of the Japanese citizens to the occupied area in Japan, which divides the travelers into two categories: the visitors with specific purposes and the immigrants with a wish to pursue a permanent stay in China. In the remark column, it also requires the assignment of identity certificates to the prostitutes, comfort women and other “women in special service.”
