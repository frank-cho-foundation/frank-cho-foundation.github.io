This document deals with the difficulties for the travelers to China who were not able to obtain the required the certificates, referring specifically to the people from Taiwan, a Japanese colony taken from China in 1894. It requests the Embassy in Guangdong to grant the travelers the access to China if they held the certificates assigned by either army or navy.
